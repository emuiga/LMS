## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The existing system does not provide for administrators to register so anybody can alter the 
information.<br>
Having to physically check for resource availability is too much work.<br>
Patrons may forget the due date of a book and therefore need a reminder.<br>
Librarians have no way to be notified when a book is due.<br>
